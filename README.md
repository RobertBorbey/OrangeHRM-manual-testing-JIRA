## 1. Introduction

OrangeHRM provides a scalable HRM solution for small and midsize businesses, ensuring the entire employment lifecycle is covered, from onboarding to termination. Some of the functionalities are:

- employee information management
- employee leave management
- recruitment management
- employee performance management
- other managerial tools

## 1.1. Project objective

We need to raise the trust in the quality of the project as high as possible before releasing it to customers.

## 1.2. Functionalities in scope

a) Login functionality as an Admin

b) Admin Module â€“ ADD, RESET, SEARCH functionalities

c) Application functionality from desktop perspective

## 1.3. Functionalities and tests out of scope

- No QA support for mobile applications developed. Only web+desktop applications will be tested
- Automation testing is beyond scope
- Non-functional testing like stress, performance is beyond scope of this project

## 2. Test process

## 2.1. Test Planning

Roles and responsibilities

I will test everything that is mentioned in "functionalities in scope".

Entry criteria:
- smoke test passed
- testing environment is up and running
- to have all browsers available for testing the cloud environment
- to have the supported environment for the desktop application

Exit criteria:
- no Critical issues have "Open Status"
- update tests have 100% passed
- 90% of tests have passed

Risks:
- stability risks (disconnects, crashes etc)
- some browsers might not be supported
- update tests might impact the user data
- stress conditions might impact the web applications

## 2.2. Test analysis
- we are planning on running a full regression test on the current version

## 2.3. Test design
- all test cases are written and reviewed

## 2.4 Test implementation
- this test run includes only regression testing in which we will run tests that have the highest priority, this will be main priority
  
## 2.5 Test execution
- the tests will be executed on the top used browser: Chrome. If time will be available we will extend tests on Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge

## 2.6 Test closure
- at least 95% of tests are passed
- no Critical issues have Open status

## 2.7 Test monitoring and control
